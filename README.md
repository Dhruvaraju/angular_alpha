### What is Angular?
- A framework to build client side applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript/Typescript
### Why do we need angular?
- Many applications are build using javascript and jquery, but as the application grows it will be hard to maintain the code base
- We need a way to properly structure our application. Even though there are javascript patterns available they are hard to understand from a beginner perspective.
- Applications build with plain javascript or Jquery are hard to test.
### Benefits of angular:
- Gives our application a clean structure.
- Includes lots of reusable code.
- Make application more testable.

 > We do not need a framework like angular to create applications in javascript, but it will make them easier to build and test.
