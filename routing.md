#Angular Routing
## What is routing
- A way to load and manage your application
- Mapping a component to a url (path maps)
- Logical structuring an application
- Route loads to a structure called router outlet ``` <router-outlet></router-outlet> ```, Path maps will be loaded in this path.
- In the index.html there is tag ```<base href="/">```, the path specified is where the routing takes place.
